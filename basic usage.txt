Each working game must call basic functions at some point. Also it must implement event listeners on `gamee.emitter` object. 

* [gamee.gameInit](#gameegameinit)
* [gamee.gameReady](#gameegameready)
* [gamee.updateScore](#gameeupdatescore)
* [gamee.gameOver](#gameegameover)
* [gamee.emitter](#gameeemitter)

***

### gamee.gameInit
Initial handshake method, game notifies Gamee platform about its existence. After calling this command (before callback is being called), game is supposed to listen to [mute and unmute events](#gameeemitter).  
In this phase, game is covered with half transparent layer.  

**Simplest example**

```javascript
// signature: controller, controllerOptions, gameCapabilities, callback
gamee.gameInit("OneButton", {}, [], function(error, data) {
    if(error !== null)
        throw error;

    var myController = data.controller;
    var sound = data.sound;
... // your code that should make game ready
});
```

***

### gamee.gameReady
Being called when game is ready to start. It signals game is able to recevie [start event](#gameeemitter). 


**Simplest example**

```javascript
gamee.gameReady();
```

**Complete usage**

```javascript
gamee.gameReady(function(error) {
    if(error !== null)
        throw error;
});
```

***

### gamee.updateScore
Updates the score making it visible for player. Also score is being saved. Should be called with every score change. 

**Simplest example**

```javascript
gamee.updateScore(10); // set score to 10
```

**Another usage**

```javascript
gamee.updateScore(10, function(error) {
    if(error !== null)
        throw error;
});
```

***

### gamee.gameOver
Notifies platform player ended the game. Game will be covered with half transparent layer with end screen again. 

**Simplest example**

```javascript
gamee.gameOver();
```

**Another usage**

```javascript
gamee.gameOver(function(error) {
    if(error !== null)
        throw error;
});
```

***

### gamee.emitter
Emitting these major events: "start", "pause", "resume", "mute" and "unmute". 

**Simplest usage**
 
 ```javascript
// Will be emitted when user will start game or restart it. 
gamee.emitter.addEventListener("start", function(event) {
    ... // your code to start

    event.detail.callback();
}); 

// Will be emitted when user paused the game. 
gamee.emitter.addEventListener("pause", function(event) {
    ... // your code to pause the game

    event.detail.callback();
}); 

// Will be emitted after user resumes the game after 
// pause or GameeApp suspension. 
gamee.emitter.addEventListener("resume", function(event) {
    ... // your code to unpause the game

    event.detail.callback();
});

// Will be emitted when user clicks the mute button 
// and the game must mute all game sounds.
gamee.emitter.addEventListener("mute", function(event) {
    ... // your code to make game silent

    event.detail.callback();
});

// Will be emitted when user clicks the unmute button
// and the game should unmute all game sounds.
gamee.emitter.addEventListener("unmute", function(event) {
    ... // your code to make game produce sound again

    event.detail.callback();
});
```
