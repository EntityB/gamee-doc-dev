## Gamee Game Principles

* No in-game menu. Players go directly to the game and our native UI guides them through the whole process.
* We prefer games that are language independent. Try not to use any text if possible.
* No adult content. Gamee games has no age minimum so the content must be appropriate for all ages.
* Playable on iOS, Android and web. Since the games are coded in HTML 5 / Javascript it has to work on every mentioned platform.
* Our default control system is portrait fullscreen. It's also possible to use some of our predefined controllers (link to the controllers section).
* Games on gamee can't have any in app purchases.
* 4 MB maximum size. We want games to load quickly, even on slow connections. So please make your games as small as you can.
